## Introduction
**Forrest Gump** was frequently referenced in different media and social settings. However, I hadn't watched it. While browsing the **IMDB top movies** list, I randomly came across it and decided to give it a watch. These are some **recollection of my thoughts** throughout the movie.

> Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).

A popular thought experiment goes something like this. Is being smarter really better? Lets assume you have an average IQ of 100 points. Somehow, you obtain 200 more points and now your IQ is 300. Will your life really be better? Or perhaps you might even kill yourself after finding out how meaningless life is with that level of intellegence. We can't comprehend the consquences that comes with it. You must have heard classic folk tales where people get 3 whishes. The first 2 wishes are beyond their comprehension and the 3rd one is to revert their 2 wishes.

Is happiness in simplicity? The movie starts with the life of Forrest gump named after a member of the [KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest). He is mentioned to have an **IQ of 75** and refused at a public school. Struggling to even walk, he is bullied thoroughout his childhood.
### Destiny 
On her death bed, Forrest's mother talks about destiny. She says "You have to do best of what god gave you" and always did her best for Forrest. Some say we have a destiny while some say life is all about randomness. So who is right here? Both of them. Welcome to the randomness of your destiny.

Let's say you throw a stone in air. Copy this universe and paste it. Now we have two of the same universe. Will both of the stones fall down? Probably. Will both of them make the same sound? Will both of them kill the same ant on the ground? Will the both of them fire some neurons and make you think something? Will the though make you do something? Will the previous action bring a consequence? Maybe you claimed to have free will and raised your right hand to prove it. But werent you already destined to do so by clicking this blog?

Sarting from the Big Bang some action has brought some consequence. One thing lead to another now its you? So, do we have free will? Apparently, only random phenomenon are subatomic particles. It might be because we are yet to understand them. Eistien used to say, **"God does not play dice."**

Yet there is so much uncertainty in this destiny. If all things were predictable, woudn't life be boring?

"Life is a box of chocolates, you never konw what you gonna get." - Forrest's Mother

*Perhaps uncertainty is the beauty of life.*

### Running
"That day for no particular reason, I started to run". He ran for 3 years. "Are you running for war, hunger, crimes, women's right ?". "People could not understand, I ran for **no particular reason**. I just fell like running".

In life we all are running. We all have to run. Do we really need a destination? Just run where you feel like running.

### Vietnam

"Were you scared in Vietnam?"

"Sometimes it would stop raining and stars would come out. It was nice."

"I wish I could have been there with you."

"You were"

### Love

"You don't know what love is."

Ironically, Forrest is the only one capable of truly loving.

*When love bekons to you follow him.*
